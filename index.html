Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs resolve to DID
Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.
      </p>

      <p>
This document specifies the interface and guidelines for the DID
resolution process.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p>DID Resolution is the process of obtaining a DID Document for a given DID. This is one of four required operations
	a client can perform on any DID ("Read/Resolve"; the other ones being "Create", "Update", and "Delete/Revoke").
	A client that is able to perform this operation is called a DID Resolver. This specification defines common
	requirements, input parameters and output data, architectural options, and various considerations for the
	DID Resolution process.</p>

	<p>DID Resolution does not involve any authentication or authorization functionality. Anybody can perform the process,
	without requiring any credentials or non-public knowledge.</p>

	<p>Note that while this specification defines some base-level functionality for DID Resolution, the actual steps required
	to communicate with a DID's target system are defined by the applicable DID method specification and can vary
	considerable between DID methods. For example, no assumption should be made that:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>... an actual DID Document is stored in plain-text on a DID's target system. While some DID methods may do this and
	support DID Resolution by simply downloading a DID Document over HTTP(S) or other protocols, other DID methods may
	define more complex multi-step procedures that involve on-the-fly construction of a DID Document.</li>
	<li>... an immutable blockchain is used as (part of) the DID's target system.</li>
	<li>... interaction with a remote network is required during the DID Resolution process.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="issue">Maybe mention "resolution" of off-ledger/microledger/edgechain DIDs (e.g. see
	<a href="https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/indy/topic/28597813">here</a> and 
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnC_nfOUK40WS5TD_EhyDuFe5cStX-u0Z7wjoae_PqQ/">here</a>.</p>

	<p class="issue">Maybe mention "resolution" of DIDs that are simply wrapped public keys (e.g. see

	<h1>Input Parameters</h1>
	<p class="issue">TODO: Describe DID Resolution input parameters, besides just DID (Reference).</p>

	<section id="input-didreference">
		<h2>DID Reference</h2>
		<p>A <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#the-generic-did-scheme">DID Reference</a> 
		is the primary (and only required) input parameter to the DID Resolution process:</p>
		<pre class="nohighlight">
did-reference      = did [";" did-service ] [ "/" did-path ] ["?" did-query ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
</pre>
		<p>For the purpose of the DID Resolution process, it is called the <dfn>input DID Reference</dfn>. Its
		DID part is called the <dfn>input DID</dfn>.</p>

		<p class="issue">
		The syntax of a DID Reference is still <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues/90">
		under discussion</a>, including how parameters such as service name and service type are specified.
		</p>

	</section>

	<section id="input-servicetype">
		<h2><code>serviceType</code></h2>
		<p>(OPTIONAL) The <code>serviceType</code> input parameter can be supplied by a client to select a specific
		service from the DID Document.</p>
		<p>See Section <a href="#service-selection"></a>.</p>

	</section>

	<section id="input-version">
		<h2><code>version</code></h2>
		<p>(OPTIONAL) The <code>version</code> input parameter can be supplied by a client to retrieve a specific
		version of a DID Document.</p>
		<p>See Section <a href="#versioning"></a>.</p>
		<p class="issue">Decide the format of version identifiers (method-specific? could be sequential number, UUID, etc.).</p> 
		<p class="issue">There can also be a timestamp input parameter that requests a version of the DID Document at a given time.</p>

	</section>

	<section id="input-cache">
		<h2><code>cache</code></h2>
		<p>(OPTIONAL) The <code>cache</code> input parameter can be supplied by a client as a hint to 
		instruct what kind of caching behavior is requested/acceptable by the client (e.g. always
		force a fresh DID Resolution process rather than getting a cached result).</p>
		<p>See Section <a href="#caching"></a>.</p>

	</section>

	<section id="input-followredirect">
		<h2><code>followRedirect</code></h2>
		<p>(OPTIONAL) The <code>followRedirect</code> input parameter can be supplied by a client as a hint to 
		instruct whether redirects should be followed.</p>
		<p>See Section <a href="#redirects"></a>.</p>

	</section>

<section>
	<h1>Output Data</h1>
	<p class="issue">TODO: Describe DID Resolution output data, besides just DID Document.</p>

	<section id="output-diddocument">
		<h2>DID Document</h2>
		<p>The DID Document associated with the DID, as defined by the DID specification, retrieved according
		to the applicable DID method specification.</p>
		<p>If input parameters of the DID Resolution process lead to a certain part of the DID Document being
		selected (e.g. <a href="#service-selection">service selection</a> by name or type), then only that part of
		the DID Document is returned.</p>
		<p class="issue">Need to define how that works exactly, and whether the original DID Document may still
		be returned, alongside the selected part.</p>
		<p class="issue">Several ways of selecting parts of a DID Document are being discussed, including the use
		of the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#fragments">DID fragment</a> or 
		<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/pull/107/files">JSON pointer</a> to locate a certain resource
		in the DID Document.</p>

	</section>

		<ul>
		<li>Duration of the DID Resolution process.</li>
		<li>Versioning information about the DID Document (see Section <a href="#versioning"></a>).</li>
		<li>Caching information about the DID Document (see Section <a href="#caching"></a>).</li>

		<h2>Method Metadata</h2>

		<li>Block number, index, transaction hash, number of confirmations, etc. of a record in the blockchain or other target system.</li>
		<li>Various URLs, IP addresses or other network information that was used during the DID Resolution process.</li>
		</ul>

	</section>

	<p class="issue">For certain data, it may be debatable whether it should be part of the DID Document
	(i.e. data that describes the DID Subject), or whether it is metadata (i.e. data about the DID Document or about
	the DID Resolution process). For example the URL of the "Continuation DID Document" in the BTCR method.
	</p>
	
	<p class="issue"> Should we include metadata in a special place inside the DID Document, or should we
	define a higher-level data structure that includes both the DID Document and the DID Resolution metadata
	separately?

<section id="caching">
	<h1>Caching</h1>
	<p>A DID Resolver may maintain a generic cache of DID Documents. It may also maintain caches specific
	to certain DID methods.</p>
	<p>Caching behavior can be controlled by configuration of the DID Resolver,
	by the <a href="#input-cache"><code>cache</code></a> input parameter, or by contents of the DID Document
	(e.g. a "time-to-live" field), or by a combination of these options.</p>

<section id="versioning">
	<h1>Versioning</h1>
	<p>If a <code>version</code> input parameter is provided, the DID Resolution process returns the DID Document
